This was a code exercise designed to challenge data display skills, made in under a week. 

The requirement was to make a bar chart and a table pulling data from a CSV, such that when the bars on the chart were clicked, the corresponding rows on the table would be highlighted.

This was made using React and D3

You can see it live here: [Avengers data](http://tapicella.github.io/d3_demo/index.html) to see a linked chart/table made using React and D3.
